# Mike Dacre's NeoVim Config

This is a remake of my [vim config](https://github.com/MikeDacre/.vim) to use
neovim initialized in February of 2018 because my vim config was too bloated
and vim was getting just too damned slow.

Anything that I have written, you can use for free without crediting me, I
don't care.  Any submodules/plugins are not mine and so everything there is
licensed by the actual authors.
